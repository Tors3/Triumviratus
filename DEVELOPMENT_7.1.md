## 1. Why speed

7.1 started with an audit of the search against the engines released in the last few months:
Stockfish 19, Reckless, PlentyChess 8, Integral 8, Caissa 2.0, Stormphrax 8 and Viridithas 20.
Porting their search ideas did **not** pay here. Three SPRTs in a row came back flat or negative:
dropping null-move pruning inside the singular search (−23 ± 19, stopped early), fail-high score
blending (−0.6 ± 7.3 on 2,502 games) and a bundle of five small ports (−4.4 ± 7.1 on 4,212 games).
Our search is tuned around its own behaviour, so a single foreign heuristic mostly shifts the balance
the tuning found.

Speed has no such problem: if the tree is identical, a faster engine is simply stronger. So the audit
turned to the question "where does our time go, compared with Stockfish?"

## 2. How it is measured

Two tools made this possible on a machine that was busy with other simulations the whole time (wall
clock varied ±20% between identical runs).

**Hardware counters.** Windows `xperf` reads the CPU's performance counters per process:
instructions retired (exact, unaffected by load), cycles, branch mispredictions and last-level cache
misses, plus samples attributed to source lines through the debug symbols. Stockfish 19 uses the
**same network dimensions** as ours (SFNNv16, L1 = 1024), so building both with the same compiler
(g++ 16, `-O3 -flto`) and running both on the same positions gives a direct, per-node comparison.

**Paired simultaneous runs** (`build/nps_pair.py`). To measure time under load, the two binaries run
**at the same moment on the two hyperthreads of one physical core**, same position, same fixed node
count, timed from outside. Whatever disturbs one disturbs the other. The processes are created
suspended and pinned before their first instruction (so the network lands in the right NUMA node's
memory); whoever finishes first keeps searching until the other is done (so neither ever has the core
to itself); the side and the start order alternate. Six cores in parallel give 360 samples in about a
minute. **Null test** (the same binary against itself): **−0.03%, 95% interval [−0.30%, +0.25%]**.

## 3. Where we started

Same compiler, same 30 positions × 400,000 nodes, per node:

| engine | instructions | cycles | branch misses |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Stockfish 19 | 6,087 | 6,678 | 28.7 |
| **Triumviratus 7.1 at the start** | **6,768** | **8,728** | **37.7** |

We did not execute many more instructions than Stockfish: the gap was **stalls** — about 30% more
branch mispredictions and more memory misses. The network code itself (accumulator updates and the
forward pass) cost the same as Stockfish's; the difference was all **around** it: move ordering,
correction history, the transposition table.

## 4. What changed (identical tree)

| change | effect |
|---|---|
| Minor/major-piece keys of the correction history kept **incrementally** in make/unmake, instead of rescanning eight bitboards up to four times per node | together with the next two: **−7.5% instructions** |
| The non-pawn key is no longer updated when the feature that uses it is off | |
| Three `thread_local` values in the NNUE bridge moved into the per-thread state | |
| **Branch-free move selection** (conditional moves) for quiets, captures and quiescence: selecting the best quiet alone caused ~11% of all branch misses | with the next two: **−20% branch misses**, −10% cycles |
| Move generator **templated on the side to move**, capture flag computed without a branch | |
| Threat tier of a square computed without branches | |
| Illegal-position guard only at the root; the child's in-check status inherited from the parent's gives-check | **−2% instructions** |
| Quiet-move scoring **per node** (history rows, masks, node cache looked up once, not per move) | −2.6% instructions |
| Hybrid accumulator refresh, pawn refresh cache and "both perspectives together" enabled on AVX-512 as well (all were switched off in August after timed measurements on a laptop) | hybrid −1.6%, pawn cache −1.4% instructions; perspectives **+0.80% NPS** |
| **Early prefetch** of the child's transposition-table and eval-cache entries, from an estimated key at the start of make (Stockfish's `key_after` idea) | **+2.21% NPS** |
| **Prefetch of the child's correction-history entries** | **+2.04% NPS** |
| **Prefetch of the threat PSQT rows** before the accumulator update uses them | **+1.76% NPS** |
| One TT probe instead of two at the search/quiescence boundary | −0.2% instructions |

With the same compiler, 7.1 now runs **5,647 instructions per node against Stockfish 19's 6,087**, with
fewer branch misses (27.3 against 28.8). The NPS gains in the table come from the paired runs, and each
has its 95% interval in the internal notes; the first batches predate the paired tool and are given
in counter terms.

## 5. Tried and dropped

- **Lazy move translation for the NNUE mirror board**: convert the move only when the position is
  evaluated. No gain (+0.15% instructions): almost every move made reaches an evaluation anyway.
- **Sorting the quiet moves once** instead of selecting: fewer instructions, more branch misses.
- **Removing the second board.** The engine keeps its own board and a Stockfish-style mirror for the
  network. Measured, the duplicated bookkeeping is about 2–2.5% of the time; the threat-delta work
  (~3%) is needed either way and Stockfish pays it too. Merging the boards would change the move
  generation order (our squares run a8 → h1, Stockfish's a1 → h8), hence the tree, for at most ~2%.
- **Dropping the eval cache.** It is not a pure cache: it returns evaluations computed with the
  optimism of the iteration that stored them, and turning it off changes the tree by 19%. That makes
  it a playing-strength question for an SPRT, not a speed one.

## 6. TT16: the one change that alters the tree

The transposition table moved from 24-byte entries in 48-byte buckets — half of which straddled two
cache lines, so a probe could cost two misses — to **16-byte entries, four per 64-byte bucket**, one
cache line per probe, about 50% more entries per MB, and the bucket index computed with a high
multiply instead of a 64-bit division. The key check (48 bits) and the stored static eval share one
word protected by the same XOR as before. Because capacity and placement change, `bench` becomes
**240500** (240503 with the old table, still available with `-DTRIUMV_TT_LEGACY`).

**Game test**, TT16 against the old table, both PGO release builds, 10+0.1, Hash 16 (small on
purpose, where capacity matters): **+6.30 ± 5.06 Elo** on 5,365 games, LOS 99.3%, pentanomial
[42, 573, 1354, 662, 46]. Stopped with zero excluded. TT16 is the 7.1 table.

## 7. Result against 7.0

PGO release builds (clang, AVX-512) of the current source against the **official 7.0 binary**
(checksum verified), with the paired tool: 30 positions × 300,000 nodes, 20 physical cores in
parallel.

| comparison | NPS | 95% interval | faster in |
|---|---:|---|---:|
| **7.0 → 7.1, old table** (identical tree, bench 240503) | **+8.70%** | [+8.63%, +8.78%] | 2,400 / 2,400 |
| 7.1 old table → 7.1 TT16 | +2.60% | [+2.42%, +2.77%] | 1,743 / 2,400 |
| **7.0 → 7.1 TT16** | **+11.54%** | [+11.40%, +11.68%] | 5,690 / 5,760 |

The two steps multiply to the direct figure (1.087 × 1.026 = 1.115). Null tests (the same binary
against itself) gave +0.05% under load and −0.10% on an idle machine, so the tool resolves about
0.1%. The +8.7% is speed and nothing else: same moves, same nodes, same tree as 7.0.

**In games**, 7.1 (TT16) against the official 7.0 binary, both PGO release AVX-512, 1 thread:

| TC | hash | games | W / D / L | pentanomial | Elo | SPRT |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|---:|---|
| 12+0.12 | 128 MB | 4,664 | 1,135 / 2,595 / 934 | [26, 478, 1131, 659, 34] | **+14.71 ± 5.41** | `[0, 3]` H1 accepted |

UHO 2024 (+0.85/+0.94). Speed is worth most at short time controls, where every extra node is a
larger share of the search; the gain is expected to shrink as the time control grows.

## 8. Status

- Every change in section 4 is in `source/` and enabled on all targets (AVX2, AVX-512, VNNI, ICL,
  `-intel`).
- **Done:** TT16 adopted (+6.3 ± 5.1); 7.1 against 7.0 at 12+0.12: +14.7 ± 5.4, SPRT passed.
- **Tried:** a correction history keyed by the last move in context (hash of parent XOR hash of
  node, as in Coda and Cinder): −7.6 ± 7.8 on 2,069 games at 20+0.2. Left in the code, switched off.
- **Cleanup:** 14 finished compile-time switches removed (the old table, the speed-work oracles,
  prefetch and permutation experiments that were measured and rejected): about 2,000 lines fewer.
  Same tree, checked: bench 240500 and identical node counts on the 50 test positions. Search
  options that are switched off stay in the code.
- **Next:** a correction history keyed by the last move in context (as in Coda and Cinder), then a
  series of **ablation tests**: switching off, one at a time, search features that were accepted on
  weak evidence or validated with older networks, to find the ones that no longer pay. After that,
  the next network (larger L1), with an L1 penalty on the feature-transformer activations in the
  recipe (one of the recipe changes behind Coda 0.9.4's gain).
- Found on the way: the engine does not support Chess960 FENs (it accepts the castling rights and then
  generates castling moves from the wrong squares). To be rejected at parse time.

**Tools** (`build/`): `nps_pair.py` (paired simultaneous NPS), `cpu_topology.py` (hyperthread
siblings), `node_identity.py` (same tree check), `uci_workload.py` (common workload for any UCI engine).

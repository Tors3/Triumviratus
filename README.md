## Triumviratus 6.0 (prerelease)

> [!NOTE]
> All details regarding the 6.0 prerelease (including new networks, SPSA tunes, time management, incremental gains, and SPRT results) have been moved to **[`DEVELOPMENT_6.0.md`](DEVELOPMENT_6.0.md)** to keep this page clean.


## License

[![License: GPLv3](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPLv3-blue.svg)](COPYING)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **GPLv3** — see [`COPYING`](COPYING). Only the **NNUE inference code** is derived from **Stockfish** (the SFNNv13 evaluation machinery in `nnue/`, GPLv3); the search, the rest of the engine, the two extra feature blocks (`PawnPair`, `PassedPawns`) and the shipped network are the project's own (see [`NETWORKS.md`](NETWORKS.md)). Because the engine incorporates that GPL code, **the whole project is distributed under GPLv3**, with Stockfish's copyright notices preserved.

### Testing & tuning

**Maurizio Platino** is the project's tester and search-tuner throughout its development. Beyond the
SPSA search-parameter tuning, he probes the engine's real playing strength by running it against
curated **hard positions at long time controls** — the kind of qualitative strength testing that fast
automated match-play cannot reach, and the project's only systematic testing of that sort — and has
generously contributed his hardware for the long tuning and testing runs. Triumviratus would be
materially weaker without his work.

### Derived code

- **[Stockfish](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish)** (GPLv3) — SFNNv13 NNUE evaluation (the `nnue/` inference machinery).
- **[BBC](https://github.com/maksimKorzh/chess_programming)** by Maksim Korzh ("Code Monkey King") — the original bitboard/magic-number move generator; the project's earliest (2024) foundation for `attacks.cpp`/`magic.cpp`/`movegen.cpp` and the first search, both since substantially rewritten and extended.
- **[Fathom](https://github.com/jdart1/Fathom)** (MIT) — Syzygy tablebase probing.

### Open-source engines studied

Ideas for search, move-ordering, time management and pruning were studied from — and in several cases
ported and then **re-tuned against the project's own data and network** — a number of open-source
engines. Credit and thanks to all of them:

- **[Reckless](https://github.com/codedeliveryservice/Reckless)** — quiet move-ordering (offense-square and king-shield-pawn terms), TT prefetch, capture-ordering ideas.
- **[Caissa](https://github.com/Witek902/Caissa)** — node-count move cache, quiescence capture history, moves-left time curve.
- **[Alexandria](https://github.com/PGG106/Alexandria)** — the multiplicative, stateless time-management factors.
- **[Pawnocchio](https://github.com/JonathanHallstrom/pawnocchio)** — inspiration for the *PawnPair* network features.
- **[Berserk](https://github.com/jhonnold/berserk)**, **[Obsidian](https://github.com/gab8192/Obsidian)**, **[Ethereal](https://github.com/AndyGrant/Ethereal)** and **[Stormphrax](https://github.com/Ciekce/Stormphrax)** — assorted search, pruning and ordering refinements.

The open-source computer-chess community is what makes a project like this possible.
